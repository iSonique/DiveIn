##DiveIn

#What is it?
DiveIn is a python class for http://online.net and more server hosters. It is also to be converted to PHP.

#What makes it different?
It supports more functions and is easy to understand.

#What made you make this?
Not many python or PHP wrappers exist for some API's so I made this.

#Whats left to do?
1. Finish the core functions.
2. Test
3. Convert to PHP
4. Add JSON decoder
5. Support more hosts
6. Convert to cron job that detects ddos and reboots server
7. If function is broke (eg; webserver) it will try to fix automatically.
8. I dunno yet lamo

#Can I reuse this?
Well yes. But I request you email me before any commercial re distribution of this software. If I reject I ask you to respect my decision.
This is provided 'as is' I do offer support but don't cannot be claimed for errors.

Thanks
